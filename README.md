# Welcome to Launch

**Launch** is a web application framework written in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) inspired by Kemal, Rails, Phoenix and other popular application frameworks.

The purpose of Launch is not to create yet another framework, but to take advantage of the beautiful Crystal language capabilities and provide engineers and the Crystal community with an efficient, cohesive, well maintained web framework that embraces the language philosophies, conventions, and guidelines.

Launch borrows concepts that have already been battle tested and successful, and embraces new concepts through team and community collaboration and analysis, which also aligns with Crystal's philosophy.
